### Hi there, I'm MUHAMMAD FARHAN WAHYU KAMIL! ðŸ‘‹

### ðŸ¤– About Me

My journey began in the world of **project management** and **communication**, where I learned to coordinate teams and build effective relationships. This experience taught me the importance of the 'human' side of any project.

Curiosity then led me to the world of data. I became fascinated by how raw numbers could be transformed into insights, and how past patterns could be used to predict the future. I started diving into Python, Pandas, and eventually **Machine Learning** through platforms like Kaggle.

My goal now is to bridge these two worlds. I don't just want to build efficient models, but also **responsible and interpretable** ones. I am particularly interested in how ML can be used to understand complex social phenomena and how we can mitigate the biases reflected in our data.
